<p class="style2">Overview:</p>
<p class="style1">The proposed study aims to develop nanoindentation techniques
  in order to accurately probe mechanical behavior of soft materials used in
  packaging.&nbsp; This
  work focuses on polymers (parylene C, PDMS) and solder materials (Sn-Ag-Cu,
  Pb-Sn).&nbsp; One goal is to extend our understanding of the nanoindentation
  mechanics and its measurement techniques to soft materials that draw special
  attention due to their significant time- and temperature-dependent deformation.</p>
<p class="style1">Polymers occupy a significant fraction of packaging materials and their share
  is expected to grow further. In addition, Pb-free solder will soon dominate
  a metallic interconnect market by replacing traditional Pb-Sn solders. There
  are, however, many unknown factors in mechanical behavior of Pb-free solders.
  From our previous studies, it was clear that these materials would create significant
  challenges to obtain accurate determination of mechanical properties through
  nanoindentation.&nbsp; It is because they are too soft and the contact response
  is distinct from that of time-independent metals or ceramics.</p>
<p class="style1">A better mechanistic understanding of the <em>temporal mechanical
    response</em> would
  thus be essential to achieve more reliable nanoindentation testing protocol
  for soft materials (Fig.1).&nbsp; Further, testing of these materials under
  ambient conditions no longer provides accurate data if they are to be exposed
  to high temperatures.&nbsp; <em>In-situ mechanical testing</em> under the condition
  that emulates elevated temperature environments needs to be implemented for
  evaluation of the materials (Fig.2).</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="ieec_fig1&2.jpg" width="720" height="324" /></p>
<p><span class="style1">The purpose of this work is to develop accurate <em>dynamic
  nanoindentation</em> that
  can resolve the aforementioned issues frequently found in soft materials.
   

   Dynamic testing is carried out by superimposing a small, sinusoidally
  varying (i.e., AC) signal on top of a DC signal that drives the motion of the
  indenter.
  
Such
  dynamic testing has been done via a dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) test
  on the macroscopic scale; however, the nanoindentation testing can provide
  it on the nano- and microscales at specific locations.&nbsp; This technique
  not only offers enough sensitivity to detect materials response from soft surfaces,
  but also differentiate actual material response from the measurement artifacts
such as a thermal drift during indentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="style1">In order to supplement experimental approaches,
    the nanoindentation simulation is being developed. For this purpose,
    the ABAQUS is used to implement finite element analysis of indentation modeling.
    This work also seeks to develop a <em>constitutive</em> model for
    the Pb-free solder that incorporates both elastic and plastic deformation
    including the effects of grain size, applied stress, temperature, and strain
    rate.&nbsp;</span><span class="style1">The combined analyses from experiments
    and simulation undertaken here will not only be useful in better understanding
    certain experimental observations, but also provide a guide for the development
of the nanoindentation testing and mechanics.&nbsp; </span></p>
