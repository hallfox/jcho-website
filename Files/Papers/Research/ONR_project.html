<p class="style2">Overview:</p>
<p class="style1">This work focused on the study of oxidation kinetics of
  pure indium solder in an attempt to develop a processing window for fluxless
  solder reflow in MEMS packaging. First, Gibbs free energy of oxidation
  was calculated through a thermodynamic survey. From there, the
  effect of moisture and oxygen on the hydrogen reducing environment was investigated
  to develop an ideal reflow environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"> All the oxidation experiments were performed on the electrochemically
  polished surface which yielded repeatable thickness measurements for ultra
  thin oxide layers.&nbsp; An
  electrochemical polishing approach enabled to produce
  an ultra smooth (&lt;10-nm roughness) finish. Spectroscopic
  ellipsometer was then employed to measure the thickness of these ultra thin
  oxide layers. Ellipsometer is preferred because of its capability
  to measuring a few nm's and non-destructive nature.&nbsp; For thicker
  oxide layers, measurements were estimated using a depth profile via dynamic
  nanoindentation.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1"> To
  experimentally verify the theoretical thermodynamic calculations, oxide thickness
  verses temperature plots were constructed.&nbsp; From these plots several conclusions
  were drawn.&nbsp; First,
  there is little or no oxidation when indium is heat treated below the melting
  temperature (Fig.1). Second, based on the Arrhenius plot there is a sharp increase
  in the activation energy after crossing the melting temperature.&nbsp; Third,
  oxidation in controlled H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>2</sub> seems
  to follow thermodynamic calculations (Fig.2).&nbsp; A
  cross-over was seen from oxidation to reduction.<br />

<p class="style1">Reduction of thick indium oxide layers in a hydrogen environment
  seemed to be more difficult.&nbsp; Reduction environmental conditions close
  to thermodynamic equilibrium point showed very slow kinetics.&nbsp; Because
  indium oxide is so stable at high temperatures it was necessary to use extreme
  temperatures (350&deg;C) to see any appreciable reduction. Controlling moisture
  level below 1 ppm seemed to be essential. </p>
<p class="style1"> From
  a kinetics standpoint it was seen that oxidation growth in air follows a logarithmic
  relationship.&nbsp; Indium solder heat treated at 145&deg;C, 180&deg;C, 220&deg;C
  all showed this behavior which is based on the theory of electron flow from
  the metal to the oxide rather than diffusion of ions through the oxide lattice.
  Oxidation kinetics in an inert environment below the melting temperature showed
  little or no oxide growth, all falling within the range of the native oxide
  layer.</p>
<span class="style1">Complementing this oxidation and reduction study is a materials
characterization of both indium and indium oxide. The mechanical
properties, elastic modulus and hardness were measured using nanoindentation.&nbsp; Microstructure
characterization was carried out using both optical microscope and atomic force
microscope (AFM). Lastly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to verify
the crystal structure of indium oxide before and after the melting temperature.&nbsp;
