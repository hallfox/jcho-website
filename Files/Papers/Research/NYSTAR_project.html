<p class="style2">Overview:</p>
<p class="style1">As electronic circuit boards become crowded with numerous discrete components,
  additional advances will require utilization of the inner spaces of electronics
  packaging for embedded component placement.&nbsp; The embedding of the passive
  components inside packaging is starting to emerge in the industry as the process
  effectively combines manufacturing, component packaging and component assembly
  into a single manufacturing process flow. This <strong>embedded technology</strong> can
  thus achieve size reduction, increased functionality, improved high frequency
  performance, cost savings and increased reliability. <br />
  <br />
  Endicott Interconnect Technologies, Inc. (EI) and The State University
  of New York at Binghamton (Binghamton University) have leveraged extensive
  expertise and research background in electronics packaging, new materials development,
  processing for small scale systems.&nbsp; In this joint project, new,
  high performance passive devices will be created for emerging <strong>system-in-packaging
  (SIP)</strong> concepts
  that tackle the above concerns.&nbsp; SIP promises a new frontier for the interconnect
  and electronics packaging industry.&nbsp; It builds on a well-established manufacturing
  infrastructure and creates value by making the package platform of choice for
  small-scale systems integration. <br />
  <br />
  Specifically, <strong>ceramic thin films of high capacitance materials</strong> will
  be embedded within the inner layers of electronic packages and will replace
  the need for placement and assembly operations of discrete surface mounted
  components. &nbsp;This project will examine  high-k dielectric materials
   and their microstructures
  will be tailored to enhance electrical performance. The proposed ceramic
  films have several advantages over existing ceramic-filled epoxy or ceramic
  paste dielectrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1"><em>In-situ</em> deposition procedure in aqueous solution</li>
  <li class="style1">Better dielectric performance (e.g., higher dielectric constant and strength)</li>
  <li class="style1">Very low processing temperatures (&lt; 100&deg;C) </li>
  <li class="style1">Tunable dielectric constant (through thickness and microstructure controls)</li>
  <li class="style1">Micro-patterning capability </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1"><strong>Anticipated Impacts:</strong></p>
<p class="style1">It is intended to design and develop a new paradigm
  of <strong>the
    embedded capacitor</strong> for emerging system-in-packaging (SIP) concepts
    using innovative ceramic thin film processing.&nbsp; Commercialization of
    the product will be an ultimate goal of this 2-year prototype product development.
    The proposed program is performed through a collaborative effort between
    BU and EI who have already launched several joint projects in recent years.
    BU team will also work closely with the office of the Technology Transfer
    and Innovation Partnerships (TTIP) at BU to bring the proposed innovative
    research to commercialization stages.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">In addition, EI has well established business relationships
  with NY State&rsquo;s
  leading technology corporations.&nbsp; Through these partnerships and joint-development
  arrangements there is a potential to provide a significant source of revenue
  for a variety of hardware related markets located in New York State.&nbsp; As
  stated above, applications of the embedded capacitor technology will advance
  the state-of-the-art in miniaturized electronics, sensors and communications
  that are vital to the success of U.S. armed forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Support for this project</strong> is provided by New
  York State Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research (NYSTAR). BU
  and EI have matched additional funding for this project. </p>
