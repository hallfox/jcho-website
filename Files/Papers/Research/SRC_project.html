  <strong>Anticipated Primary Result:</strong></p>
<p class="style1">Primary result of this research is the demonstration of the
  feasibility of using ceramic-organic template-polymer trilayer coatings
  to be used for harsh environment electronic packages, as well as for MEMS devices.
  This hybrid coating can also eliminate a hermetic sealing requirement, thereby
  dramatically reducing manufacturing cost and size.</p>
<p class="style2">Background:</p>
<p class="style1">Current demands for electronic/MEMS packages include environmental
  protection from moisture, temperature, and airborne particles. Organic materials
  (substrates, underfills, etc.) are widely used in packaging applications, but
  cannot be used under harsh environments. Given that, surface coatings can provide
  a means of protection. In particular, one of the major bottlenecks for the
  continued growth of MEMS products has been packaging technology, which is responsible
  for 75% to 95% of the overall cost of a MEMS device. In addition, many MEMS
  applications demand inert/vacuum inside the package. Both electronic and MEMS
  packages must be low cost, miniaturized, and facilitate simple assembly operations.
  Cost reduction is driving the need to develop a non-hermetic approach according
  to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Given the
  above challenges, we seek to develop a solution precursor processing of strain-tolerant,
  protective  ceramic coating. This coating consists of an integrated inorganic-organic
  hybrid coating with a hard surface and a thin organic layer.
  The ceramic coating offers an inert, protective layer, while the organic coating
  not only acts as a template but also provides strain tolerance for the ceramic
  coating. With the aid of the encapsulating overmold or coating, the ceramic
  coating can work as a hermetic packaging alternative. </p>
<p class="style2">Description:</p>
<p class="style1">This project explores enabling processes that can deposit
  ceramic coatings on a variety of organic materials used in electronic packages,
  and silicon structures used in MEMS. The ability to protect base materials
  from degradation by environmental factors, and to maintain hermeticity is a
  major goal. For this purpose, we employ a hard surface coating that can
  act as a multipurpose protective layer. It is natural to choose ceramics as
  a top coating, since they have a prerequisite hardness and wear/erosion resistance.
  A major challenge is to avoid the weaknesses that ceramic coatings inherently
  possess, i.e., low strain tolerance, brittleness and difficulty to produce
  a uniform, dense layer. In an effort to overcome this difficulty, nanometer
  scale organic coatings, fabricated by self-assembly processes, are used as
  a &lsquo;template&rsquo; for
  the subsequent growth of ceramic coatings. This underlying organic coating
  also acts as a buffer layer by providing compliance for the overlying hard
  coating upon mechanical and thermomechanical stresses during frequent temperature
  changes as well as processing. An overarching goal of this project
  is to have the ability to synthesize and deposit bilayer coatings consisting
  of top ceramic and underlying organic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coating
  on two representative materials; organic materials and silicon. The ceramic
  coatings will be processed at low temperatures (e.g., &lt; 100&deg;C). We evaluate
  several oxide materials (e.g., ZrO<sub>2</sub>,
  TiO<sub>2</sub>,
  SiO<sub>2</sub>) for the ceramic coatings.
  Since we are employing a solution precursor technique, we can easily change
  the composition of the materials, which allows us to test various materials
  systems. Molecular level understanding of the coating microstructure and micromechanics
  involved in the coating processes is systematically approached via experimental
  tools such as AFM and nanoindenter, as well as numerical models. While pursuing
  our goal, we utilize an integrated design approach to optimize packaging
  structure so that overall performance (mechanical, thermal, and electrical
  properties) of the devices is not degraded.</p>
