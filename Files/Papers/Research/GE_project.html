<p class="style2">Overview:</p>
<p class="style1">In this work, we identify and develop packaging materials
    for high-temperature electronic components that can be used for instrumentation
    in deep gas drilling systems.&nbsp; There is an urgent demand for this technology
    to meet with the US natural gas consumptions in the near future.&nbsp; Drilling
    for natural gas below 20,000 ft has, however, presented the electronics industry
    with a huge challenge. The materials must withstand high-temperature (&gt;200Å&deg;C)
    high pressure (&gt;15,000 psi), and corrosive environments, as well as the
  electronics must be designed to have high damping capacity.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">Most of existing organic materials used in electronic
    packaging are substantially degraded under such environments, thereby requiring
    more durable engineered materials and/or protective surfaces.&nbsp; The proposed
    work develops enabling technology and apply the technology to offer tremendous
    opportunities in enhancing capabilities of the drilling systems. Given that,
    we explore <strong>new concepts in packaging</strong> by proposing
    innovative materials and processes for this technology. In the proposed work,
    we focus on materials design, engineering development, and test of the
    prototype of the packaging materials and structures. Specific activities
    to be performed to achieve this goal include:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1">Identification of organic materials that can withstand the above harsh
    conditions </li>
  <li class="style1">Modeling of packaging materials and structures under various
    conditions (e.g., CTE mismatch, different thicknesses and geometries, polymer
    shrinkage at use temperatures, flexible vs. rigid, corrosive and vibratory
    environments)</li>
  <li class="style1">Static/dynamic mechanical measurements of organic materials
    at ambient conditions as well as under high temperatures for
    property validation and generation of materials properties for modeling work</li>
  <li class="style1">Microstructure-property relationships to better understand
    material performance    </li>
  <li class="style1">Selection of enabling packaging materials and processes for the gas drilling
    techniques (based upon modeling and measurement results)</li>
  <li class="style1">Testing of prototype packaging systems</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1"><strong>Support for this project</strong> is provided by General
  Electric Global Research under Department of Energy (DOE) prime cooperative
  agreement DE-FC26-06NT42950. </p>
