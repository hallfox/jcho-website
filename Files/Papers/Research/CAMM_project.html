<p class="style2">Overview:</p>
<p align="left" class="style1">Organic electronics such as organic light emitting diode (OLED)
  received great attention both in consumer and military applications.&nbsp; On
  rigid glass or Si substrates, isolation of the OLED from oxygen and moisture
  is typically accomplished with a glass or a metal lid, attached to the display
  substrate using a bead of UV-cured epoxy.&nbsp; When organic substrates are
  employed in flexible display applications, a barrier layer is required on the
  substrate to protect the enclosed functional materials and layers from oxygen
  and water permeation.&nbsp; One requirement is that the barrier coatings on
  the substrate not interfere with light transparency when emitted through this
  layer. </p>
<span class="style1">The proposed work follows the &lsquo;<em>biomimetic</em>&rsquo; processing route
by using the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as a &lsquo;template&rsquo; for the
deposition of ceramic barrier coatings on a polymer substrate. The underlying
SAM coating also acts as a buffer layer by providing compliance for the overlying
hard ceramic coating upon mechanical and thermomechanical stresses [1].&nbsp; This
bilayer structure (ceramic-SAM) is overlaid on the polymer layer that ensures
a conformal coverage over the organic substrate. In particular, ceramic is processed
at very low temperature (&lt; 100ÅãC) in aqueous solution, so the process is applicable
to OLED structures, cheap and environment-friendly.&nbsp;</span>
<p class="style2">Anticipated Results:</p>
<p class="style1"> The proposed coatings would deliver <strong>enabling materials
    and processes for the conformal barrier coatings on the organic substrates
    for OLED layers</strong> that need protection from moisture and oxygen. The
    coatings are compatible with flexible substrates used in roll-to-roll manufacturing.
    They would not spall or be cracked for bending due to its strain tolerance
    resulting from the unique layered structure consisting of ceramic &ndash; buffer
layer (SAM) &ndash; polymer, and its nano-particulate microstructure.&nbsp; </p>
